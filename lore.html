            <p class="content">
                In 1989, a small group of <a href="#bomboclats">Bomboclat</a> outcasts decided they were tired of the war against
                <a href="#count-dracula">Count Dracula</a> so they fled north into <a href="#canada">Canada</a>. In Canada, they quickly stumbled upon
                a huge maple forest. As they had been travelling for a long time and were hungry, they
                tried to eat the leaves and found out they did not taste good. One of them, however, did
                realise that drying the leaves and smoking them did taste good.<br><br>
                As they headed into the city, Canadians saw them smoking the maple and asked to try it.
                After they saw everyone enjoying it, they decided to start selling the drug. It quickly
                became very popular and the CCIA (Canadian Central Intelligence Agency) started to secretly
                fund their dealing in exchange for a cut of the profit to improve Canada's infrastructure.
                <br><br>
                The Maple Cartel are insistent on the fact that they are entirely seperate from the Bombos
                and are peaceful unlike the Bombo's violent nature.

                Canadians can only speak using Canadian stereotypes as words, such as
                'ice hockey' and 'poutine'.
                <br><br>
                Before the 1990s, Canada was only Toronto and empty 
                space everywhere else, with a few maple forests scattered throughout, especially
                near the American border, until the Maple Cartel began generating stupendous amounts
                of money which allowed Canada to build more.
                <br><br>
                In the early 1990s, nearly the entire
                country was a giant vast city which was just Toronto duplicated. America and the CIA
                noticed Canada's huge economic growth and did not want to let their status of most
                powerful country be challenged. They launched a full-scale attack against Canada which
                caused a decade-long war.
                <br><br>
                The war ended abruptly in 2002 when the CIA thought Canada
                was responsible for the 9/11 attacks, although the CCIA denied it, and decimated the entire country using nuclear
                weapons. Canada is now as it was pre-90s, with Toronto as its only settlement, everywhere
                else being a wasteland or a maple forest.

                In 1984, West Korea was founded. It was an incredibly advanced underwater

                and the island rises for 12 minutes every 12 hours, to ensure its secrecy
                is kept.<br><br>
                It had a large brutalist concrete building that was intended to
                be a prison for keeping chomos away from the outside world, until in 1986
                a new inmate called <a href="#bao">Bao</a> ate all the other prisoners and all the guards.
                Bao is currently using the building as a storage facility for all his

                removal from the island, as he is too dangerous.
